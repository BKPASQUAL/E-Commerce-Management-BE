## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the backend project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Steps to Set Up the Project

#### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone <https://github.com/BKPASQUAL/E-Commerce-Management-BE.git>
```

#### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory
Move into the project directory using:
```bash
cd <project-folder>
```
Replace `<project-folder>` with the name of the folder containing the project files.

#### 3. Install Dependencies
Install all the required packages by running:
```bash
npm install
```
This will install all the dependencies specified in the `package.json` file.

#### 4. Run the Project Locally
Start the server with the following command:

npm start
```

If the setup is successful, you should see the following messages in the terminal:
```
SERVER RUNNING ON PORT 8080
Successfully connected to MongoDB!
```

#### 5. Access the Local Application
Check the terminal for the URL or port where the server is running (e.g., `http://localhost:5000` or the specified port in the configuration).

If you encounter issues during setup, ensure that:

- All prerequisites are installed correctly.
- The repository URL is correct.
- The terminal/command prompt has the necessary permissions.
